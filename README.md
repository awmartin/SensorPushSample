# SensorPush API with Processing

This is sample code for accessing the beta API for [SensorPush](http://www.sensorpush.com/) devices
with [Processing](https://processing.org).

It provides some niceties that enable you to request data from sensors attached to a SensorPush
Gateway easily. It manages the OAuth flow, caches the auth tokens for subsequent requests, provides
objects that make working with the JSON responses easy, etc.
